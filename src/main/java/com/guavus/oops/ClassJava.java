    class declarations can include these components in order:

Modifiers: A class can be public or have default access (Refer to this for details).
Class name: The class name should begin with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
Superclass (if any): The name of the classâ€™s parent (superclass), if any, preceded by the keyword extends. A class can only extend (subclass) one parent.
Interfaces (if any): A comma-separated list of interfaces implemented by the class, if any, preceded by the keyword implements. A class can implement more than one interface.
Body: The class body is surrounded by braces, { }.
